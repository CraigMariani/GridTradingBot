Risk = ticks at risk * tick value * position size

Risk should be no more than 10 percent of the account
Say we have $1000 and we risk $100

Use the exmple below to calculate position size 
Position size is how we manage our risk 
We have five grid lines with a stop loss below the 5th line 
This means we have a stop loss at this percentage

100 = 600 * 1 * position_size

total position size = 0.166
